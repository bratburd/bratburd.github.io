excerpt: 'The  criminal  justice  system  depends  on  forensic  science  methods  to analyze  evidence  collected  following  the  commission  of  crimes.  Yet,  scientific  investigations such as the 2009 National Research Council (NRC) report on forensic science reveal troubling limitations in forensic techniques applied today (National Research Council 2009).Since the report,  federal  and  state  agencies  have  made  only  limited  progress  in  reforming  forensic science   practices.   Furthermore,   in   2017,   U.S.   Attorney   General   Sessions   dissolved   the National  Forensic  Science  Commission,  charging  states  to  establish  their  own  regulations (Hsu 2017).Many states have not addressed two critical points: (1) improvement of scientific clarity  and  standards  of  forensic  methods,  and  (2)  evaluation  of  current  and  future  forensic practices.  Scientific  evidence  is  essential  in  many  cases  in  criminal  courts;  therefore,  states must   prioritize   improving   the   quality   and   reliability   of   forensic   science   methods.   We recommend establishing a forensic science commission for the state of Wisconsin to improve the soundness of forensic science, certify forensic facilities, and investigate major complaints. A  commission  with  a  strong  scientific  foundation  can  bolster  the  credibility  of  the  criminal justice system, safeguard against wrongful convictions, and ensure public safety.'
