Jenny Bratburd is a PhD Candidate in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research interests are how beneficial microbes with each and with their hosts to protect hosts from infection. She currently works microbial symbioses in two systems: human gut microbes and Salmonella interactions using a germ-free mouse model, and fungus-growing ant symbiosis with the defensive mutualist bacteria. She is advised by [Dr. Cameron Currie](https://currielab.wisc.edu/). She also serves as the Policy Engagement Coordinator for [Catalyts for Science Policy](https://casp.wisc.edu/), where she has focused on raising awareness about policies to improve the science behind forensic science. 

Prior to her PhD, she earned her B.S. in Microbial Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. During that time, she studied factors affecting acquisition and transmission Grapevine leafroll-associated virus in mealybug vectors in [Rodrigo Almeida's lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/almeidalab/).
